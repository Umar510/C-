Run-Time Polymorphism using

1- Function Overriding (Virtual Function)

Virtual function helps us to call correct function in function overriding (Dynamic Polymorphism).

Pure virtual function: 
Abstract Classes: A class is abstract if it has at least one pure virtual function.


Abstraction is the method of hiding the unwanted information. Whereas encapsulation is a method to hide the data in 
a single entity or unit along with a method to protect information from outside. We can implement abstraction using 
abstract class and interfaces.

Virtual functions are invoked when you have a pointer or reference to an instance of a class.(Upcasting)

A class is abstract if it has at least one pure virtual function.
